= Continuous Integration infrastructure
Kaitai Project
:toc: left

Kaitai Struct project sports a relatively complex CI (Continuous
Integration) pipeline. This document describes how it's working.

[[overview]]
== High-level overview

Kaitai Struct CI strives to be highly modular and, by design, tries
not to rely on a single CI engine provider. Currently, we use:

* https://travis-ci.org/kaitai-io[Travis]
* AppVeyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GreyCat/kaitai-struct[for kaitai_struct], https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GreyCat/ci-targets[for ci_targets]
* GitHub Actions: https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/actions[for kaitai_struct_formats]

With so many different jobs/flows, it's hard to rely on CI providers
internal tools (such as job browsers, test browsers, log explorers,
etc), so we're using our own link://ci.kaitai.io/[CI dashboard] to
unify all the data coming from different test runs/sources and monitor
current status of the compiler.

The following (clickable) chart gives an overview of CI
pipeline, tracing the path for one particular target language (Ruby):

On a high level, it can be summarized as:

* We build the compiler: sources are in
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler[compiler repo],
  all dependencies are fetched automatically by build tooling (sbt).
* This results in several packages, which get published as artifacts
  to several artifact stores (our "unstable builds"). Some of these
  unstable builds trigger other products' pipelines (such as
  https://ide.kaitai.io/[Web IDE]).
* We run internal compiler unit tests (`test_compiler`).
* We fetch test .ksy files from
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_tests[tests repo] (~150
  tests), and run compiler on them, asking for every possible target
  language.
* This produces ~150 tests × ~15 targets ~ 1500 compiled format files
  in various target languages. We push them all into
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/ci_targets[ci_targets repo] at GitHub.
* Once `ci_targets` is updated, this triggers lots of CI jobs in
  various environments in parallel. Every such job tests one
  particular target language in one particular environment. To
  identify them, we give every such job a name in form of
  `language/environment`. For example:
** `ruby/1.9` tests "ruby" target language in default (Linux)
   environment, using Ruby 1.9 (at Travis).
** `cpp_stl_11/msvc141_windows_x64` tests "cpp_stl_11" (which is
   actually a subvariant of "cpp_stl" target with compiler options set
   to generate exactly C++11 code using STL library), building and
   running it in Windows environment with Microsoft Visual C++
   compiler, toolkit version 141, x64 architecture. This job runs in
   AppVeyor CI.
* Every test job eventually produces test results, which get pushed
  into https://github.com/kaitai-io/ci_artifacts/[ci_artifacts
  repo]. Every job gets individual branch: for example,
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/ci_artifacts/tree/ruby/1.9[ruby/1.9
  branch] keeps results of `ruby/1.9` test run.
* Finally, these test results can be viewed online at our
  link://ci.kaitai.io/[CI dashboard], which is a simple JavaScript
  app which fetches and aggregates all test results from all runs on
  the fly.

== Main CI pipeline in details

[[compiler]]
=== Compiler

Compiler is the heart of everything in Kaitai Struct, so it's only
natural that we focus on making compiler maintenance as automated as
possible.

* Everything starts with
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler[compiler] repo.
* A new commit (or build request) for compiler repo triggers building
  of new compiler binaries. There are two builds running:
** https://travis-ci.org/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct[compiler build at
   Travis] runs on Linux and gets us .deb, .zip and .js builds of
   compiler
** https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GreyCat/kaitai-struct[compiler
   build at AppVeyor] runs on Windows and gets us .msi Windows
   installer build of compiler
* These build results are already useful (as unstable builds for other
  projects / people who would like to test bleeding edge features) and
  they get published as artifacts:
** Universal .zip packages get published in
   https://bintray.com/kaitai-io/universal_unstable/kaitai-struct-compiler[universal_unstable
   folder], powered by Bintray
** Linux .deb packages get published in
   https://bintray.com/kaitai-io/debian_unstable/kaitai-struct-compiler[debian_unstable
   repo], powered by Bintray
** Windows .msi packages become available at
   https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GreyCat/kaitai-struct/build/artifacts[AppVeyor
   project build artifacts]
** JavaScript compiler build gets packaged as npm module and published
   as
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/kaitai-struct-compiler[kaitai-struct-compiler
   npm package]

NOTE: Direct links / instructions how to reach these downloads are
available as "unstable" at link://kaitai.io/[Kaitai homepage /
Download]

* After compiler builds are finished, we run the internal compiler
  unit tests (`test_compiler`). These are
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler/tree/master/jvm/src/test/scala/io/kaitai/struct[included
  inside compiler repo] and are supposed to test individual functions
  & methods inside the compiler.

[[ci-targets-build]]
=== Building tests formats

After we've got the compiler, next steps is to take "test formats" (a
large bunch of different input .ksy files) and run compiler on
them. `build_formats` process does that. To do that, we'll need:

* Obviously, pre-built kaitai-struct-compiler
* Test format files (.ksy), which will come from
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_tests/tree/master/formats[formats/
  dir in tests repo]

This results in many files in target languages generated in
`compiled/$LANG` directories. That directory gets pushed into
https://github.com/kaitai-io/ci_targets[ci_targets repo]. One can use
version control history in that repo to track which formats code
generation has changed over development iterations.

[[ci-targets-run]]
=== Running test formats

The exact mechanism of "building and running tests" largely depends
on target language and environment, but there are a few common
things:

* The scripts to automate it come from
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_tests[tests repo] again.
* All these runs require some
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_tests/tree/master/src[binary
  inputs that they will parse] — these also come from same tests repo.
* All languages require its relevant KS runtime to build & run. For
  example, for Ruby, we'll fetch
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_ruby_runtime[ruby_runtime
  repo] at this stage.

[[formats]]
=== Formats gallery

link://formats.kaitai.io/[Formats gallery] is a static website, which
provides user-friendly rendition of contents of our
https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/[formats repo].

Its pipeline is very simple and consists of
https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/actions[only one job,
running on GitHub Actions]:

* It fetches latest *stable* KS compiler from
  https://bintray.com/kaitai-io/debian/kaitai-struct-compiler[our own
  repository at bintray].
* Then it uses it and
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/tree/master/_build[some
  script magic] to build compiled versions of these formats and,
  ultimately, static website.
* Static website gets published into
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/formats-kaitai-io.github.io[formats-kaitai-io.github.io
  repo], which is served over HTTP to everyone as link://formats.kaitai.io/[\http://formats.kaitai.io/]
