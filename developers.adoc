Kaitai Project
:toc: left

KS project consists of several subprojects, each of which has its own
repository:

* https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler[compiler] —
  everything starts here, this is the core of the project that
  everything uses
* https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_tests[tests] — used to
  prove that compiler behaves as expected and there are no regressions
  introduced by the changes
* https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/tree/master/runtime[runtimes],
  one per each target language — used by the code generated by a
  compiler
* https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_doc[documentation] —
  keeps users informed about the language and all new features
* https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_visualizer[console
  visualizer and tools: ksv, ksdump]

Technically, one can download and work with each of these subprojects
individually, but most people just download everything by checking out
https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct[our main umbrella project] that
includes (almost) everything:

[source,shell]
git clone --recursive https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct.git

Note the `--recursive` option, which would download all the
submodules. If you forgot it and cloned without it, you can still do
it manually after cloning:

[source,shell]
git submodule update --init --recursive

== Compiler

KS compiler is written in https://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala language]
and thus uses https://www.scala-sbt.org/[SBT] for building. It can be
compiled in one of 2 ways, each of which can be packaged in one of
several ways:

* generating Java `.class` files, to be run in JVM
** not packaged, ready to be ran from a build dir (so called "stage
   build")
** packaged as universal (.zip) package
** packaged as Debian (.deb) package
** packaged as Windows (.msi) installer package
* generating JavaScript `.js` file, to be run either inside a browser
  or in node.js environment
** not packaged, used as a source JS file on a website
** packaged as https://www.npmjs.com/[npm] package

=== Prerequisites

To build the compiler, one generally needs just these two things:

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
* Scala Build Tool (sbt)

For Debian/Ubuntu, this should be enough to download every
prerequisite (JRE is pulled automatically by sbt):

[source,shell]
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt

Manual installation:

* https://www.java.com/en/download/[Download JRE from official site]
* https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html[Download sbt from official site]

NOTE: You don't need whole Java Development Kit (JDK), unless you want
to test & develop for Java target — just JRE is enough for KS
compiler.

All other dependencies (including Scala runtimes, compilers, etc)
required for *the compiler* are downloaded and installed by sbt
automatically. It shouldn't really matter even which version of sbt
you use for bootstrap, as sbt will pull relevant sbt update packages
automatically as well.

=== Configuring proxy

Note, that if you behind proxy, you need to run `sbt` with flags
[source]
  -Dhttp.proxyHost=<your proxy server>
  -Dhttp.proxyPort=<your proxy server port>
  -Dhttps.proxyHost=<your proxy server>
  -Dhttps.proxyPort=<your proxy server port>

For example
[source,shell]
  sbt -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=3128 -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=3128

Unfortunately, `sbt` doesn't understand `http(s)_proxy` environment variable properly, if it contains
address of proxy server in `host:port` format, so flags is necessary.

This flags needed only on first run or when you want to check and upgrade dependencies. After first `sbt`
run all dependencies will be downloaded and access to the internet not required anymore.

=== Building for JVM

We use https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/[sbt-native-packager] to
build deployable formats. Note that in order to perform the following builds,
one must be in the `kaitai_struct/compiler` directory.

==== Building an universal (.zip) package

https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/universal.html[SBT native packager: universal package docs]

. `sbt compilerJVM/universal:packageBin`
. Get result in `jvm/target/universal/kaitai-struct-compiler-*.zip`

==== Building https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/debian.html[Debian package]

. Install prerequisites: `sudo -i apt-get install dpkg dpkg-sig dpkg-dev lintian fakeroot`
. `sbt compilerJVM/debian:packageBin`
. Get result in `jvm/target/kaitai-struct-compiler_*_all.deb`

==== Building Windows package

https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/windows.html[SBT native packager: Windows package docs]

. Install WIX
. `sbt compilerJVM/windows:packageBin`
. Get result in `jvm/target/windows/kaitai-struct-compiler.msi`
. Rename to add version to `kaitai-struct-compiler-$VERSION.msi`

=== Building for JavaScript platform

Building to JavaScript platform is done using a Scala.js project. Note
that it uses a somewhat different set of dependencies, as they must
actually be JavaScript libraries, not Java jars.

. Run `sbt fastOptJS`
. Get result in `js/target/scala-2.11/kaitai-struct-compiler-fastopt.js`
. Use this JavaScript file on a website

=== Publishing a new version

. Choose a new version number (WIX imposes harsh requirements for
  version to look like `x.x.x.x`) and update it in `build.sbt`,
  `version := ...`, commit
. Prepare an entry in RELEASE_NOTES.md, commit
. Create version tag:
  * `git tag $VERSION`
  * `git push --tags`
. Update https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct[main repository]
. Create new version at:
  * https://bintray.com/kaitai-io/debian/kaitai-struct-compiler/new/version
  * https://bintray.com/kaitai-io/universal/kaitai-struct-compiler/new/version
. Upload:
  * https://bintray.com/kaitai-io/debian/kaitai-struct-compiler/$VERSION/upload
  ** Debian distribution: `jessie`
  ** Debian component: `main`
  ** Debian architecture: `all`
  ** Attached file: `jvm/target/kaitai-struct-compiler_*_all.deb`
  * https://bintray.com/kaitai-io/universal/kaitai-struct-compiler/$VERSION/upload
  ** Target path: `$VERSION`
  ** Attached file: `jvm/target/universal/kaitai-struct-compiler-*.zip`
  * https://bintray.com/kaitai-io/universal/kaitai-struct-compiler/$VERSION/upload
  ** Target path: `$VERSION`
  ** Attached file: `jvm/target/windows/kaitai-struct-compiler-*.msi`
. Publish them all

=== Publishing new version to oss.sonatype.org

. Verify that one has OSS Sonatype login/password for `iokaitai` org.
. Preliminary setup (needs to be done once per machine — verified for
  sbt 1.1)
  * Set up credentials: create `$HOME/.sbt/.credentials` with the
    following contents (replacing XXX with username and password):

    ----
    realm=Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager
    host=oss.sonatype.org
    user=XXX
    password=XXX
    ----
  * Set up `$HOME/.sbt/1.0/plugins/credentials.sbt` with the following
    contents:

    [source,scala]
    ----
    credentials += Credentials(Path.userHome / ".sbt" / ".credentials")
    ----
  * Make sure GPG keys are present
. `sbt publishSigned`
. Go to https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories
. Continue to follow Java runtime publishing instructions
