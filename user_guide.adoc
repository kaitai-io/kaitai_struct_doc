== Introduction

Kaitai Struct is a domain-specific language (DSL) that is designed
with one particular task in mind: dealing with arbitrary binary
formats.

Parsing binary formats is hard, and that's a reason for that: such
formats were designed to be machine-readable, not human-readable. Even
when one's working with a clean, well-documented format, there are
multiple pitfalls that await the developer: endianness issues,
in-memory structure alignment, variable size structures, conditional
fields, repetitions, fields that depend on other fields previously
read, etc, etc, to name a few.

Kaitai Struct tries to isolate the developer from all these details
and allow to focus on the things that matter: the data structure
itself, not particular ways to read or write it.

== Installation and invocation

Kaitai Struct has somewhat diverse infrastructure around it, this
chapter will give an overview of the options available.

=== Web IDE

If you're going to try Kaitai Struct for the first time, then probably
it's the easiest way to get started. Just open
https://ide.kaitai.io/[Kaitai Struct Web IDE] and you're
ready to go:

image::img/webide_png_example.png[caption="Figure 1: ", title="Kaitai Struct Web IDE (sample PNG file + png.ksy loaded)", alt="Kaitai Struct Web IDE (sample PNG file + png.ksy loaded)", width="1335", height="811"]

=== Desktop / console version

If you don't fancy using a hex dump in a browser, or played around
with that and want to integrate Kaitai Struct into your project build
process automation, you'd want a desktop / console solution. Of
course, Kaitai Struct offers that as well.

==== Installation

Please refer to http://kaitai.io/#download[official website] for
installation instructions. After installation, you're expected to
have:

* `ksc` (or `kaitai-struct-compiler`) - command-line Kaitai Struct
  compiler, a program that translates `.ksy` into parsing libraries in
  a chosen target language.
* `ksv` (or `kaitai-struct-visualizer`, optional) - console visualizer

NOTE: `ksc` shorthand might be not available if your system doesn't
support symbolic links - just use the full name then.

If you're going to invoke `ksc` frequently, you'd probably want to add
it to your executable searching `PATH`, so you don't have to type full
path to it every time. You'd get that automatically on .deb package
and Windows .msi install (provided you don't disable that option) -
but it might take some extra manual setup if you use a generic .zip
package.

==== Invocation

Invoking `ksc` is easy:

[source,shell]
----
ksc [options] <file>...
----

Common options:

* `<file>...` — source files (.ksy)
* `-t <language> | --target <language>` — target languages (`cpp_stl`,
  `csharp`, `java`, `javascript`, `perl`, `php`, `python`, `ruby`, `all`)
** `all` is a special case: it compiles all possible target
    languages, creating language-specific directories (as per language
    identifiers) inside output directory, and then creating output
    module(s) for each language starting from there
* `-d <directory> | --outdir <directory>` — output directory
  (filenames will be auto-generated)

Language-specific options:

* `--dot-net-namespace <namespace>` — .NET namespace (C# only, default: Kaitai)
* `--java-package <package>` — Java package (Java only, default: root package)
* `--php-namespace <namespace>` — PHP namespace (PHP only, default: root package)

Misc options:

* `--verbose` — verbose output
* `--help` — display usage information and exit
* `--version` — output version information and exit

== Workflow overview

As you might have already read on the project's website, the main idea
of Kaitai Struct is that you create a description of a binary data
structure format using a formal language, save it as `.ksy` file, and
then you compile it with KS compiler into target programming language

TODO

== Kaitai Struct language

With the workflow issues out of the way, let's concentrate on the Kaitai
Struct language itself.

=== Fixed-size structures

Probably the simplest thing KS can do is reading fixed-size structures.
You might know them as C struct definitions - consider something like
this fictional database entry that keeps track of the dog show
participants:

[source,c]
----
struct {
    char uuid[16];       /* 128-bit UUID */
    char name[24];       /* Name of the animal */
    uint16_t birth_year; /* Year of birth, used to calculate the age */
    double weight;       /* Current weight in kg */
    int32_t rating;      /* Rating, can be negative */
} animal_record;
----

And here is how it would look in .ksy:

[source,yaml]
----
meta:
  id: animal_record
  endian: be
seq:
  - id: uuid
    size: 16
  - id: name
    type: str
    size: 24
    encoding: UTF-8
  - id: birth_year
    type: u2
  - id: weight
    type: f8
  - id: rating
    type: s4
----

It's the https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/[YAML]-based format,
plain and simple. Every .ksy file is a type description. Everything
starts with a `meta` section: this is where we specify top-level info on
the whole structure we describe. There are two important things here:

* `id` specifies name of the structure
* `endian` specifies default
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness[endianness]:
** `be` for big-endian (AKA "network byte order", AKA Motorola, etc)
** `le` for little-endian (AKA Intel, AKA VAX, etc)

With that out of the way, we use `seq` element with an array (ordered
sequence of elements) in it to describe which attributes this structure
consists of. Every attribute includes several keys, namely:

* `id` is used to give attribute a name
* `type` designates attribute type:
** no type means that we're dealing with just a raw byte array; `size`
is to be used to designate number of bytes in this array
** `s1`, `s2`, `s4`, `u1`, `u2`, `s4`, etc for integers
*** "s" means signed, "u" means unsigned
*** number is the number of bytes
*** if you need to specify non-default endianness, you can force it by
appending `be` or `le` - i.e. `s4be`, `u8le`, etc
** `f4` and `f8` for IEEE 754 floating point numbers; `4` and `8`,
again, designate the number of bytes (single or double precision)
*** if you need to specify non-default endianness, you can force it by
appending `be` or `le` - i.e. `f4be`, `f8le`, etc
** `str` is used for strings; that is almost the same as "no type", but
string has a concept of encoding, which must be specified using
`encoding`

YAML-based syntax might look a little more verbose than C-like struct,
but there are a few good reasons to use it. It is consistent, it is
easily extendable, and it's easy to parse, so it's easy to make your own
programs/scripts that work with .ksy specs.

A very simple example is that we can add docstrings to every attribute,
using syntax like that:

[source,yaml]
----
  - id: rating
    type: s4
    doc: Rating, can be negative
----

These docstrings are just the comments in .ksy, they'll actually get
exported into target language as well (for example, in Java they'll
become JavaDoc, in Ruby they'll become RDoc/YARD, etc). This, in turn,
is super helpful when editing the code in various IDEs that will
generate reminder popups for intelligent completion, when you browse
through class attributes:

image::img/completion_javadoc.png[caption="Figure 2: ", title="JavaDoc is generated automatically from `doc`", alt="JavaDoc is generated automatically from `doc`", width="1188", height="366"]

NOTE: You can use https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/[YAML]
folded style strings for longer documentation that spans multiple lines:

[source,yaml]
----
  - id: opcode
    type: u1
    doc: >
      Operation code that defines which operation should be performed
      by a virtual machine. Subsequent parameters for operation depend
      on the value of opcode.
----

=== Checking for "magic" signatures

Many file formats use some sort of safeguard measure against using
completely different file type in place of the required file type. The
simple way to do so is to include some "magic" bytes (AKA "file
signature"): for example, checking that first bytes of file are equal to
their intended values provides at least some degree of protection
against such blunders.

To specify "magic" bytes (i.e. fixed content) in structures, KS includes
a special `contents` key. For example, this is the beginning of a `seq`
for Java .class file:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: magic
    contents: [0xca, 0xfe, 0xba, 0xbe]
----

This reads first 4 bytes and compare them to 4 bytes `CA FE BA BE`. If
there would be any mismatch (or there would be less than 4 bytes read),
that'll throw an exception and stop parsing at early stage, before any
damage (pointless allocation of huge structures, waste of CPU cycles)
would be done.

Note that `contents` is very flexible and you can specify there:

* An UTF-8 string - bytes from such a string would be used to check
against
* An array with:
** integers in decimal representation
** integers in hexadecimal representation, starting with 0x
** UTF-8 strings

In case of using an array, all elements' byte representations would be
concatenated and expected in sequence. Few examples:

[source,yaml]
----
  - id: magic1
    contents: JFIF
    # expects bytes: 4A 46 49 46
  - id: magic2
    # we can use YAML block-style arrays as well
    contents:
      - 0xca
      - 0xfe
      - 0xba
      - 0xbe
    # expects bytes: CA FE BA BE
  - id: magic3
    contents: [CAFE, 0, BABE]
    # expects bytes: 43 41 47 45 00 42 41 42 45
----

More extreme examples to illustrate the idea (i.e. possible, but
definitely not recommended in real-life specs):

[source,yaml]
----
  - id: magic4
    contents: [foo, 0, A, 0xa, 42]
    # expects bytes: 66 6F 6F 00 41 0A 2A
  - id: magic5
    contents: [1, 0x55, '▒,3', 3]
    # expects bytes: 01 55 E2 96 92 2C 33 03
----

NOTE: There's no need to specify `type` or `size` for fixed contents
data - it all comes naturally from the `contents`.

=== Variable-length structures

Many protocols and file formats tend to conserve bytes, especially for
strings. Sure, it's stupid to have a fixed 512-byte buffer for a string
that typically is 3-5 bytes long and only rarely can be up to 512 bytes.

One of the most common methods used to mitigate this problem is to use
some integer to designate length of the string, and store only
designated number of bytes in the stream. Unfortunately, this yields
variable-length structure, and it's impossible to describe such thing
using C-style structs. However, it's not a problem for KS:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: my_len
    type: u4
  - id: my_str
    type: str
    size: my_len
    encoding: UTF-8
----

Note the `size` field: we use not a constant, but a reference to a field
that we've just parsed from a stream. Actually, you can do much more
than that - you can use a full-blown expression language in `size`
field. For example, what if we're dealing with UTF-16 string and
`my_len` value designates not a number of bytes, but number of byte
pairs?

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: my_len
    type: u4
  - id: my_str
    type: str
    size: my_len * 2
    encoding: UTF-16LE
----

One can just multiply `my_len` by 2 - and voila - here's our UTF-16
string. Expression language is very powerful, we'll be talking more
about it later.

Last, but not least, we can specify a `size` that spans automatically to
the end of the stream. For that one, we'll use slightly different
syntax:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: some_int
    type: u4
  - id: string_spanning_to_the_end_of_file
    type: str
    encoding: UTF-8
    size-eos: true
----

=== Enums (named integer constants)

The nature of binary format encoding dictates use that in many cases
we'll be using some kind of integer constants to encode certain
entities. For example, a widely known IP packet uses 1-byte integer to
encode protocol type for the payload: 6 would mean "TCP" (which gives us
infamous TCP/IP), 17 would mean "UDP" (which yields UDP/IP), and 1 means
"ICMP".

It is possible to live with just raw integers, but most programming
language actually provide a way to program using meaningful string names
instead. This approach is usually dubbed "enums" and it's totally
possible to generate a enum in KS:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: protocol
    type: u1
    enum: ip_protocol
enums:
  ip_protocol:
    1: icmp
    6: tcp
    17: udp
----

Alternatively, hexadecimal notation can also be used to define an enumeration:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: key
    type: u4
    enum: keys
enums:
  keys:
    0x77696474: width #widt
    0x68656967: height #heig
    0x64657074: depth #dept
----

There are two things that should be done to declare a enum:

1.  We add `enums` key on the type level (i.e. on the same level as
`seq` and `meta`). Inside that key, we add a map, keys of it being names
of enum (in this example, there's only one enum declared, `ip_protocol`)
and values being yet another map, which maps integer values into
identifiers.
2.  We add `enum: ...` parameter to every attribute that's going to be
represented by that enum, instead of just being a raw integer. Note that
such attributes must have some sort of integer type in the first place
(i.e. `type: u*` or `type: s*`).

=== Substructures (subtypes)

What do we do if we need to use many of the strings in such a format?
Writing so many repetitive `my_len`- / `my_str`-style pairs would be so
bothersome and error-prone. Fear not, we can define another type,
defining it in the same file, and use it as a custom type in a stream:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: track_title
    type: str_with_len
  - id: album_title
    type: str_with_len
  - id: artist_name
    type: str_with_len
types:
  str_with_len:
    seq:
      - id: len
        type: u4
      - id: value
        type: str
        encoding: UTF-8
        size: len
----

Here we define another type named `str_with_len`, which we reference
just by doing `type: str_with_len`. The type itself is defined using
`types:` key on top-level type. That's a map, inside it we can define as
many subtypes as we want. We define just one, and inside it we just nest
the exact same syntax as we use for the type description on the top
level - i.e. the same `seq` designation.

NOTE: There's no need for `meta` here, as type name is derived from
`types` key name here.

Of course, one can actually have more levels of subtypes:

TODO

=== Accessing attributes in other types

Expression language (used, for example, in `size` key) allows you to
refer not only attributes in current type, but also in other types.
Consider this example:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: header
    type: main_header
  - id: body
    size: header.body_len
types:
  main_header:
    seq:
      - id: magic
        contents: MY-SUPER-FORMAT
      - id: body_len
        type: u4
----

If `body_len` attribute was in the same type as `body`, we could just
use `size: body_len`. However, in this case we've decided to split the
main header into separate subtype, so we'll have to access it using `.`
operator - i.e. `size: header.body_len`.

Obviously, one can chain attributes with `.` to dig deeper into type
hierarchy - i.e. `size: header.subheader_1.subsubheader_1_2.field_4`.
But sometimes we need just the opposite: how do we access upper-level
elements from lower-level types? KS provides two options here:

==== `_parent`

One can use special pseudo-attribute `_parent` to access parent
structure:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: header
    type: file_header
  - id: metadata
    type: metadata_section
types:
  file_header:
    seq:
      - id: version
        type: u2
  metadata_section:
    seq:
      - id: author
        type: strz
        encoding: UTF-8
      - id: publisher
        type: strz
        encoding: UTF-8
        if: _parent.header.version >= 2
----

==== `_root`

In some cases, it would be way too impractical to write tons of
`_parent._parent._parent._parent...` or just plain impossible (if you're
describing an type which might be used on several different levels, thus
different number of `_parent` would be needed). In this case, we can use
special pseudo-attribute `_root` to just start navigating from the very
top-level type:

TODO

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: header
    type: main_header
types:
  main_header:
    seq:
      - id: magic
        contents: MY-SUPER-FORMAT
      - id: body_len
        type: u4
      - id: subbody_len
        type: u4
----

=== Conditionals

Some protocols and file formats have optional fields, which only exist
on some conditions. For example, one can have some byte first that
designates if some field exists (1) or not (0). In KS, you can do that
using `if` key:

....
seq:
  - id: has_crc32
    type: u1
  - id: crc32
    type: u4
    if: has_crc32 != 0
....

In this example, we again use expression language to specify a boolean
expression in `if` key. If that expression is true, field is parsed and
we'll get a result. If that expression is false, field will be skipped
and we'll get a `null` or it's closest equivalent in our target
programming language if we'll try to get it.

At this point, you might wonder how that plays together with enums.
After you mark some integer as "enum", it's no longer just an integer,
so you can't compare it directly with the number. Instead you're
expected to compare it to other enum values:

....
seq:
  - id: my_animal
    type: u1
    enum: animal
  - id: dog_tag
    type: u4
    # Comparing to enum literal
    if: my_animal == animal::dog
enums:
  animal:
    1: cat
    2: dog
....

There are other enum operations available, we'll cover them in
expression language guide later.

=== Repetitions

Most real-life file formats do not contain only one copy of some
element, but might contain several copies, i.e. they repeat the same
pattern over and over. Repetition might be:

* element repeated up to the very end of the stream
* element repeated a pre-defined number of times
* element repeated while some condition is satified (or until some
condition won't become true)

KS supports all these types of repetitions. In all cases, it will create
a resizable array (or nearest equivalent available in target language)
and populate it with elements.

==== Repeat until end of stream

This is the simplest kind of repetition, done by specifying
`repeat: eos`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: numbers
    type: u4
    repeat: eos
----

This yields an array of unsigned integers, each is 4 bytes long, which
spans till the end. Note that if we've got a number of bytes left in the
stream that's not divisible by 4 (for example, 7), we'll end up reading
as much as possible, and then parsing procedure will throw an
end-of-stream exception. Of course, you can do that with any type,
including user-defined types (subtypes):

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: filenames
    type: filename
    repeat: eos
types:
  filename:
    seq:
      - id: name
        type: str
        size: 8
        encoding: ASCII
      - id: ext
        type: str
        size: 3
        encoding: ASCII
----

This one defines an array of records of type `filename`. Each individual
`filename` consists of a 8-byte `name` and 3-byte `ext` strings in ASCII
encoding.

==== Repeat for a number of times

One can repeat an element a certain number of times. For that, we'll
need an expression that will give us number of iterations (which would
be exactly the number of items in resulting array). It could be a simple
constant to read exactly 12 numbers:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: numbers
    type: u4
    repeat: expr
    repeat-expr: 12
----

Or we might reference some attribute here to have an array with length
specified inside the format:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: num_floats
    type: u4
  - id: floats
    type: f8
    repeat: expr
    repeat-expr: num_floats
----

Or, using expression language, we can even do some more complex math on
it:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: width
    type: u4
  - id: height
    type: u4
  - id: matrix
    type: f8
    repeat: expr
    repeat-expr: width * height
----

This one specifies `width` and `height` of the matrix first, then parses
as many `matrix` elements as needed to fill a `width` × `height` matrix
(although note that it won't be a true 2D matrix: it would still be just
a regular 1D array, and you'll need to convert (x, y) coordinate to
address in that 1D array manually).

==== Repeat until condition is met

Some formats don't specify the number of elements in array, but instead
just use some sort of special element as a terminator that signifies end
of data. KS can do that as well using `repeat-until` syntax, for
example:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: numbers
    type: s4
    repeat: until
    repeat-until: _ == -1
----

This one reads 4-byte signed integer numbers until encountering `-1`. On
encountering `-1`, the loop will stop and further sequence elements (if
any) will be processed. Note that `-1` would still be added to array.

Underscore (`_`) is used as a special variable name that refers to the
element that we've just parsed. When parsing an array of user types, it
is possible write a `repeat-until` expression that would reference some
attribute inside that user type:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: records
    type: buffer_with_len
    repeat: until
    repeat-until: _.len == 0
types:
  buffer_with_len:
    seq:
      - id: len
        type: u1
      - id: value
        size: len
----

=== Typical TLV implementation (switching types on an expression)

"TLV" stands for "type-length-value", and it's a very common staple in
many formats. The basic idea is that we do modular and
reverse-compatible format. On the top level, it's very simple: we know
that the whole format is just an array of records (`repeat: eos` or
`repeat: expr`). Each record starts the same: there is some marker that
specifies _type_ of the record and an integer that specifies record's
__length__. After that, record's body follows, and the body format
depends on the _type_ marker. One can easily specify that basic record
outline in KS like that:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: rec_type
    type: u1
  - id: len
    type: u4
  - id: body
    size: len
----

However, how do we specify the format for `body` that depends on
`rec_type`? One of the approaches if using conditionals, as we've seen
before:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: rec_type
    type: u1
  - id: len
    type: u4
  - id: body_1
    type: rec_type_1
    size: len
    if: rec_type == 1
  - id: body_2
    type: rec_type_2
    size: len
    if: rec_type == 2
  # ...
  - id: body_unidentified
    size: len
    if: rec_type != 1 and rec_type != 2 # and ...
----

However, it's easy to see why it's not a very good solution:

* We end up writing lots of repetitive lines
* We create lots of `body_*` attributes in a type, while in reality only
only `body` would exist - everything else would fail the `if` comparison
and thus would be null
* If we want to catch up the "else" branch, i.e. match everything not
matched with our `if`s, we have to write an inverse of sum of `if`s
manually. For anything more than 1 or 2 types it quickly becomes a mess.

That is why KS offers an alternative solution. We can use switch type
operation:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: rec_type
    type: u1
  - id: len
    type: u4
  - id: body
    size: len
    type:
      switch-on: rec_type
      cases:
        1: rec_type_1
        2: rec_type_2
----

This is much more concise and easier to maintain, isn't it? And note
that `size` is specified on attribute level, thus it applies to all
possible type values, setting us a good hard limit. What's ever better -
even if you're missing the match, as long as you have `size` specified,
you would still parse `body` of a given size, but instead of
interpreting it with some user type, it will be treated as having no
`type`, thus yielding a raw byte array. This is super useful, as it
allows you to work on TLV-like formats step-by-step, starting with
support of only 1 or 2 types of records, and gradually adding more and
more types.

You can use "_" for the default (else) case which will match every
other value which was not listed explicitly.

[source,yaml]
----
    type:
      switch-on: rec_type
      cases:
        1: rec_type_1
        2: rec_type_2
        _: rec_type_unknown
----

If an enumeration has already been defined, you can use references to
items in the enumeration instead of specifying integers a second time:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: key
    type: u4
    enum: keys
  - id: data
    type:
      switch-on: key
      cases:
        keys::width: data_field_width
        keys::height: data_field_height
        keys::depth: data_field_depth
types:
  data_field_width:
    seq:
      #...
  data_field_height:
    seq:
     #...
  data_field_depth:
    seq:
     #...
enums:
  keys:
    0x77696474: width #widt
    0x68656967: height #heig
    0x64657074: depth #dept
----

=== Instances: data beyond the sequence

So far we've done all the data specifications in `seq` - thus they'll
get parsed immediately from the beginning of the stream, one-by-one, in
strict sequence. But what if the data you want is located at some other
position in the file, or comes not in sequence?

"Instances" are the Kaitai Struct's answer for that. They're specified
in a key `instances` on the same level as `seq`. Consider this example:

[source,yaml]
----
meta:
  id: big_file
  endian: le
instances:
  some_integer:
    pos: 0x400000
    type: u4
  a_string:
    pos: 0x500fff
    type: str
    size: 0x11
    encoding: ASCII
----

Inside `instances` we need to create a map: keys in that map would be
attribute names, and values specify attribute in the very same manner as
we would have done it in `seq`, but there is one important additional
feature: using `pos: ...` one can specify a position to start parsing
that attribute from (in bytes from the beginning of the stream). Just as
in `size`, one may use expression language and reference other
attributes in `pos`. This is used very often to allow accessing file
body inside a container file when we have some file index data: file
position in container and length:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: file_name
    type: str
    size: 8 + 3
    encoding: ASCII
  - id: file_offset
    type: u4
  - id: file_size
    type: u4
instances:
  body:
    pos: file_offset
    size: file_size
----

Another very important difference between `seq` attribute and
`instances` attribute is that instances are lazy by default. What does
it mean? Unless someone would call that `body` getter method
programmatically, no actual parsing of `body` would be done. This is
super useful for parsing larger files, such as images of filesystems. It
is impractical for a filesystem user to load all the filesystem data
into memory at once: one usually finds a file by its name (traversing
file index somehow), and then can access file's `body` right away. If
that's the first time this file is being accessed, `body` will be loaded
(and parsed) into RAM. Second and all subsequent times will just return
a cached copy from the RAM, avoiding any unnecessary re-loading /
re-parsing, thus conserving both RAM and CPU time.

Note that from the programming point of view (from the target
programming languages and from internal Kaitai Struct's expression
language), `seq` attributes and `instances` are exactly the same.

=== Calculated ("value") instances

Sometimes, it is useful to transform the data (using expression
language) and store it as a named value. There's another sort of
instances for that - calculated (AKA "value") instances. They're very
simple to use, there's only one key in it - `value` - that specifies
expression to calculate:

....
seq:
  - id: length_in_feet
    type: f8
instances:
  length_in_m:
    value: length_in_feet * 0.3048
....

Value instance does no actual parsing, and thus do not require `pos`
key, or `type` key (type will be derived automatically).

=== Bit-sized integers

IMPORTANT: Feature available since v0.6.

Quite a few protocols and file formats, especially those who aim to
conserve space, pack multiple integers into same byte, using integer
sizes less that 8 bits. For example, IPv4 packet starts with a byte
that packs both version and header length:

....
76543210
vvvvllll
  |   |
  |   +- header length
  +----- version
....

Here's how it can be parsed with KS:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: version
    type: b4
  - id: header_len
    type: b4
----

NOTE: By convention, KS starts parsing bits from most significant to
least significant, so "version" comes first here, and "header_len"
second.

Using `type: bX` (where X is a number of bits to read) is very
versatile and can be used to read byte-unaligned data. A more complex
example of packing, where value spans two bytes:

....
76543210 76543210
aaaaabbb bbbbbbcc
....

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: a
    type: b5
  - id: b
    type: b9
    # 3 bits + 6 bits
  - id: c
    type: b2
----

Or it can be used to parse completely unaligned bit streams with
repetitions. In this example, we parse an arbitrary number of 3-bit
values:

....
           76543210 76543210 76543210 76543210
           nnnnnnnn 00011122 23334445 55666777 ...
           ----+--- ---___----___---____
               |     |  |  |   |  |   |
num_threes ----+     |  |  |   |  |   |
threes[0]  ----------+  |  |   |  |   |
threes[1]  -------------+  |   |  |   |
threes[2]  ----------------+   |  |   |
threes[3]  --------------------+  |   |
threes[4]  -----------------------+   |
threes[5]  ---------------------------+
  ...
....

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: num_threes
    type: u1
  - id: threes
    type: b3
    repeat: expr
    repeat-expr: num_thress
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, if you'll mix "normal" byte-sized integers (i.e. `uX`,
`sX`) and bit-sized integers (i.e. `bX`), byte-sized integers will be
kept byte-aligned. That means if you do:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: foo
    type: b6
  - id: bar
    type: u1
----

two bytes will get parsed like that:

....
    76543210 76543210
    ffffff   bbbbbbbb
    --+---   ---+----
      |         |
foo --+         |
bar ------------+
....

i.e. two least significant bits of the first byte would be lost and
not parsed due to alignment.
====

Last, but not least, note that it's also possible to parse bit-packed
integers using old-school methods with value instances. Here's the
very first example with IPv4 packed start, unpacked manually:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: packed_1
    type: u1
instances:
  version:
    value: packed_1 & 0b00001111
  header_len:
    value: packed_1 >> 4
----

Such method is useful when you need to do more intricate bit
combinations, like a value with its bits scattered across several
bytes sparsely.

=== Streams and substreams

====Introduction and simple example====

A stream is a flow of data from an input file into a parser which is
generated by a KS script. The parser can request one or more bits of
data from the stream at a time, but cannot request the same data twice
and cannot request data be provided out of sequential order. A stream
knows the maximum amount of data available to be requested by the
parser and the actual amount of data which has already been
requested by the parser.

When a file is first opened for parsing by a parser generated by KS,
a root stream is created. This root stream can be accessed via
`_root._io` at any time and in any place. In this scenario, `_root`
returns the top level object defined in a script, and `_io` is a
method which can be called on an object to return the associated
stream. The root stream will know the maximum amount of data available
to be requested by the parser as the file size of the input file which
is being parsed. Initially, the root stream will know that 0 bits of
data have been requested by the parser.

Below is an example script which is used to generate a parser which
is then used to parse an input file. Assume that this example input
file simply consists of a 32-bit unsigned integer value of 1000
followed by 1000 bytes of payload data. This example input file thus
has a total file size of 1004 bytes.

[source,yaml]
----
meta:
  - id: example_file
seq:
  - id: header
    type: file_header
  - id: body
    type: file_body
    size: header.body_size
types:
  file_header:
    seq:
      - id: body_size
        type: u4
  file_body:
    seq:
      - id: payload
        size-eos: true
----

The parser generated by the script will first request 4 bytes of data
from the root stream to copy into the object `header.body_size`. After
the stream has returned the 4 bytes of data to the parser, the stream
will know that it has returned 4 out of the 1004 bytes of data available
to the parser. The parser is now only able to request 1000 bytes of
additional data from the stream.

The definition of the `body` object in the example script specifies the
size of the `body` object to be the already-parsed value of
`header.body_size`. Defining an object size results in something
interesting happening with the KS-generated parser--a new substream is
created to specifically parse the `body` object.

Similar to how the root stream operates, the new substream initially
knows the maximum amount of data available to be requested, and the
actual amount of data already returned. In this example, the substream
upon creation has a maximum of 1000 bytes of data which can be
requested by the parser. The substream will know the actual amount of
data which has been provided is 0 bytes.

The parser will then continuously request data from the new substream
to copy into the object `file_body.payload`. As the substream receives
requests for more data, the substream will pass all requests to the
root stream. Unlike the root stream, substreams are only able to
request data from either the root stream or other substreams.
Substreams do not read from an input file directly.

Because `size-eos: true` is specified for the `file_body.payload`
object, the parser will continue requesting data from the substream
until the actual amount of data provided by the substream is 1000
bytes (the maximum amount of data which the substream is available
to provide). Upon all 1000 bytes of data being copied from the input
file, via the root stream and then via the substream to the
`file_body.payload` object, the internal state of the two streams
would be:
* root stream--maximum bytes of data available remains 1004, actual
               amount of data already requested is 1004 bytes
* substream--maximum bytes of data available remains 1000, actual
             amount of data already requested is 1000 bytes

Alternatively, if `header.body_size` happens to be a value larger than
the input file size, the root stream would be unable to fulfill this
request, and the KS-generated parser would abruptly raise an exception
for trying to read non-existent data beyond the end of the input file.

The `_io` method can be used to access the stream associated with an
object. An object can be obtained by identifier, or alternatively by
methods `_root` and `_parent`. Once a stream has been obtained with
the `_io` method, a number of different methods can be used to obtain
the internal state of the stream:
* `size` to return the maximum amount of data which is available to be
  requested from the stream
* `pos` to return the actual amount of data which has already been
  requested from the stream
* `eof` to return a boolean value of `false` when `pos != size` and
  `true` when `pos == size` (has the maximum amount of data available
  via the stream already been requested?)

Substreams can be nested many layers deep by defining the `size` of
each object in the nested tree.

Related expressions which are useful when working with streams include:
* `repeat: eos`
* `size-eos: true`

=== Processing: dealing with compressed, obfuscated and encrypted data

Some formats obscure the data fully or partially with techniques like
compression, obfuscation or encryption. In this cases, incoming data
should be pre-processed before actual parsing would take place, or we'll
just end up with the garbage getting parsed. All such pre-processing
algorithms has one thing in common: they're done by some function that
takes a stream of bytes and return the stream of bytes (note that number
of incoming and resulting bytes might be different, especially in case
of decompression). While it might be possible to do such transformation
in declarative manner, it is usually impractical to do so.

KS allows to plug-in some predefined "processing" algorithms that allow
to do mentioned de-compression, de-obfuscation and de-cryption to get a
clear stream, ready to be parsed. Consider parsing a file, in which the
main body is obfuscated by applying XOR with 0xaa for every byte:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: body_len
    type: u4
  - id: body
    size: body_len
    process: xor(0xaa)
    type: some_body_type # defined normally later
----

Note that:

* Applying `process: ...` in available only to raw byte arrays or user
types.
* One might use expression language inside `xor(...)`, thus referencing
XOR obfuscation key read in the same format into some other field
previously

== Expression language

Expression language is a powerful internal tool inside Kaitai
Struct. In a nutshell, it is a simple object-oriented, statically-type
language that gets translated/compiled (AKA "transpiled") into any
supported target programming language.

The language is designed to follow the principle of least surprise, so
it borrows tons of elements from other popular languages, like C,
Java, C#, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Scala, etc.

=== Basic data types

Expression language operates on the following primitive data types:

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Type
|Attribute specs
|Literals

|Integers
|`type: uX`, `type: sX`, `type: bX`
|`1234`, `-789`, `0xfc08`, `0b1101`

|Floating point numbers
|`type: fX`
|`123.0`, `-456.78`, `4.1607804e+72`

|Booleans
|`type: b1`
|`true`, `false`

|Byte arrays
|`size: XXX`, `size-eos: true`
|`[0x20, 65, 66, 67]`

|Strings
|`type: str`, `type: strz`
|`'foo bar'`, `"baz\nqux"`

|Enums
|(`type: uX` or `type: sX`) and `enum: XXX`
|`opcode::jmp`

|Streams
|N/A
|N/A
|===

*Integers* come from `uX`, `sX`, `bX` type specifications in sequence
or instance attributes (i.e. `u1`, `u4le`, `s8`, `b3`, etc), or can be
specified literally. One can use:

* normal decimal form (i.e. `123`)
* hexadecimal form using `0x` prefix (i.e. `0xcafe` - both upper case and lower case letters are legal, i.e. `0XcAfE` or `0xCAfe` will do as well)
* binary form using `0b` prefix (i.e. `0b00111011`)
* octal form using `0o` prefix (i.e. `0o755`)

It's possible to use `_` as a visual separator in literals — it would
be completely ignored by parser. This could be useful, for example,
to:

* visually separate thousands in decimal numbers: `123_456_789`
* show individual bytes/words in hex: `0x1234_5678_abcd`
* show nibbles/bytes in binary: `0b1101_0111`

*Floating point numbers* also follow the normal notation used in vast
majority of languages: `123.456` will work, as well as expontential
notation: `123.456e-55`. Use `123.0` to enforce floating point type to
an otherwise integer literal.

*Booleans* can be specified as literal `true` and `false` values as in
most languages, but also can be derived by using `type: b1`. This
method parses a single bit from a stream and represents it as a
boolean value: 0 becomes false, 1 becomes true. This is very useful to
parse flag bitfields, as you can omit `flag_foo != 0` syntax and just
use something more concise, such as `is_foo`.

*Byte arrays* are defined in the attribute syntax when you don't
specify anything as `type`, but specify `size` or `size-eos`
instead. Byte array literals use typical array syntax like the one
used in Python, Ruby and JavaScript: i.e. `[1, 2, 3]`. There is a
little catch here: the same syntax is used for "true" arrays of
objects (see below), so if you'll try to do stuff like `[1, 1000, 5]`
(`1000` obviously won't fit in a byte), you won't get a byte array,
you'll get array of integers instead.

*Strings* normally come from using `type: str` or `type: strz`.
Literal strings can be specified using double quotes or single
quotes. The meaning of single and double quotes is similar to those of
Ruby, PHP and Shell script:

* Single quoted strings are interpreted literally, i.e. backslash `\`,
  double quotes `"` and other possible special symbols carry no
  special meaning, they would be just considered a part of the
  string. Everything between single quotes is interpreted literally,
  i.e. there is no way one can include a single quote inside a single
  quoted string.
* Double quoted strings support escape sequences and thus allow to
  specify any characters. The supported escape sequences are as
  following:

[cols="1,1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Escape seq
|Code (dec)
|Code (hex)
|Meaning

|`\a`
|7
|0x7
|bell

|`\b`
|8
|0x8
|backspace

|`\t`
|9
|0x9
|horizontal tab

|`\n`
|10
|0xa
|newline

|`\v`
|11
|0xb
|vertical tab

|`\f`
|12
|0xc
|form feed

|`\r`
|13
|0xd
|carriage return

|`\e`
|27
|0x1b
|escape

|`\"`
|34
|0x22
|double quote

|`\'`
|39
|0x27
|single quote (technically not required, but supported)

|`\\`
|92
|0x5c
|backslash

|`\123`
|
|
|ASCII character with octal code 123; one can specify 1..3 octal digits

|`\u12bf`
|
|
|Unicode character with code U+12BF; one must specify exactly 4 hex digits

|===

NOTE: One of the most widely used control characters, ASCII zero
character (code 0) can be specified as `\0` - exactly as it works in
most languages.

CAUTION: Octal notation is prone to errors: due to its flexible
length, it can swallow decimal digits that appear after the code as
part of octal specification. For example, `a\0b` is three characters:
`a`, ASCII zero, `b`. However, `1\02` is interpreted as two
characters: `1` and ASCII code 2, as `\02` is interpreted as one octal
escape sequence.

TODO: Enums

*Streams* are internal objects that track the byte stream that we
parse and state of parsing (i.e. where's the pointer at). There is no
way to declare a stream-type attribute directly by parsing
instructions or specify it as a literal. Typical way to get stream
objects is to query `_io` attribute from a user-defined object: that
will give us a stream associated with this particular object.

=== Composite data types

There are two composite data types in the expression language
(i.e. data types which include other types are components).

==== User-defined types

Basically, that's the types one defines using `.ksy` syntax -
i.e. top-level structure and all substructures defined in `types` key.

Normally, they are translated into classes (or their closest available
equivalent - i.e. storage structure with members + access members) in
target language.

==== Arrays

Array types are just what one might expect from all-purpose, generic
array type. Arrays come from either using the repetition syntax
(`repeat: ...`) in attribute specification, or by specifying a literal
array. In any case, all KS arrays have underlying data type that they
store, i.e. one can't put strings and integers into the same
array. One can do arrays based on any primitive data type or composite
data type.

NOTE: "True" array types (described in this section) and "byte arrays"
share the same literal syntax and lots of method API, but they are
actually very different types. This is done on purpose, because many
target languages use very different types for byte arrays and arrays
of objects for performance reasons.

One can use array literals syntax to declare an array (very similar to
syntax used in JavaScript, Python and Ruby). Type will be derived
automatically based on types of values inside brackets, for example:

* `[123, 456, -789]` - array of integers
* `[123.456, 1.234e+78]` - array of floats
* `["foo", "bar"]` - array of strings
* `[true, true, false]` - array of booleans
* `[a0, a1, b0]` - given that `a0`, `a1` and `b0` are all the same
  objects of user-defined type `some_type`, this would be array of
  user-defined type `some_type`

WARNING: Mixing multiple different types in a single array literal
would trigger a compile-time error, for example, this is illegal: `[1,
"foo"]`

=== Operators

Literals can be connected using operators to make meaningful
expressions. Operators are type-dependent: for example, same `+`
operator applied to two integers would mean arithmetic addition, and
applied to two strings would mean string concatentation.

==== Arithmetic operators

Can be applied to integers and floats:

* `a + b` - addition
* `a - b` - subtraction
* `a * b` - multiplication
* `a / b` - division
* `a % b` - modulo; note that it's not a remainder: `-5 % 3` is `1`,
  not `-2`; the result is undefined for negative `b`.
* `a ** b` - exponentiation (`a` in power of `b`)

NOTE: If both operands are integer, result of arithmetic operation is
integer, otherwise it is floating point number. For example, that
means that `7 / 2` is `3`, and `7 / 2.0` is `3.5`.

Can be applied to strings:

* `a + b` - string concatenation

==== Relational operators

Can be applied to integers, floats and strings:

* `a < b` - true if `a` is strictly less than `b`
* `a <= b` - true if `a` is less or equal than `b`
* `a > b` - true if `a` is strictly greater than `b`
* `a >= b` - true if `a` is greater or equal than `b`

Can be applied to integers, floats, strings, booleans and enums (does
proper string value comparsion):

* `a == b` - true if `a` is equal to `b`
* `a != b` - true if `a` is not equal to `b`

==== Bitwise operators

Can be only applied to integers.

* `a << b` - left bitwise shift
* `a >> b` - right bitwise shift
* `a & b` - bitwise AND
* `a | b` - bitwise OR
* `a ^ b` - bitwise XOR

==== Logical (boolean) operators

Can be only applied to boolean values.

* `not x` - boolean NOT
* `a and b` - boolean AND
* `a or b` - boolean OR

=== Methods

Just about every value in expression language is an object (including
literals), and it's possible to call methods on it. The common syntax
to use is `obj.method(param1, param2, ...)`, which can be abbreviated
to `obj.method` if no parameters are required.

Note that then `obj` in question is a user-defined type, you can
access all its attributes (both sequence and instances) using the same
`obj.attr_name` syntax. Obviously, one can chain that to traverse a
chain of substructures: `obj.foo.bar.baz` (given that `obj` is a
user-defined type that has `foo` field, which points to user-defined
type that has `bar` field, and so on).

There are a few pre-defined methods that form kind of a "standard
library" for expression language.

attributes or instances) by their name. In addition to that, there are

== Advanced techniques

=== Importing types from other files

As your project grows in complexity, you might want to have multiple
.ksy files: for example, for different file formats, structures,
substructures, or to reuse same subformat in several places. As most
programming languages, Kaitai Struct allows you to have multiple
source files and has `imports` functionality for that.

Using multile files is very easy. For example, given that you have a
`date.ksy` file that describes the date structure:

[source,yaml]
----
meta:
  id: date
seq:
  - id: year
    type: u2le
  - id: month
    type: u2le
  - id: day
    type: u2le
----

and you want to use it in a file listing specification
`filelist.ksy`. Here's how to do that:

[source,yaml]
----
meta:
  id: filelist
  # this will import "date.ksy"
  imports:
    - date
seq:
  - id: entries
    type: entry
    repeat: eos
types:
  entry:
    seq:
      - id: filename
        type: strz
        encoding: ASCII
      # just use "date" type from date.ksy as if it was declared in
      # current file
      - id: timestamp
        type: date
      # you can access its members too!
      - id: historical_data
        size: 160
        if: timestamp.year < 1970
----

Generally, you just add an array in `meta/imports` and list all you
want to import there. There are 2 ways to address the files:

Relative::
  Uses path given as relative path to the file, starting with the same
  directory as main .ksy file resides. It's useful to include files in
  the same directory or to navigate to somewhere in your
  project. Examples include: `foo`, `foo/bar`, `../foo/bar/baz`, etc.
Absolute::
  Looks like `/foo` or `/foo/bar` (i.e. starting with a slash), and
  searches for the given .ksy file in module search path(s). This is
  usually used to modules from centralized repositories / ksy
  libraries. Module search paths are determined by (in order of
  decreasing priority):

  * Paths given using command-line `-I` switch.
  * Paths given using `KSPATH` environment variable (multiple paths
    can be specified separated with `:` on Linux/OS X and with `;` on
    Windows)
  * Default Platform-dependent search paths, determined in compiler
    build time and/or during installation

  In Web IDE you obviously don't have environment and command-line
  switches, so absolute path imports are used to reference modules in
  preloaded "kaitai.io" library.

CAUTION: Please use only forward slashes `/` in import paths for
consistency. Kaitai Struct will convert them automatically to proper
platform-dependent path separator (`/` or `\`).

=== Opaque types: plugging in external code

Sometimes you'd want KS-generated code to call a code in your
application to do the parsing, for example, to parse some text- or
state-based format. For that, you can instruct ksc to generate code
with so-called "opaque" types.

Normally, if a compiler encounters a type which is not declared either
in current file or in one of the imported files, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
meta:
  id: doc_container
seq:
  - id: doc
    type: custom_encrypted_object
----

... it will output an error:

 /seq/0: unable to find type 'custom_encrypted_object', searching from doc_container

If we want to provide our own implementation of
`custom_encrypted_object` type, first we need to compile our .ksy file
with `--opaque-types=true` option. This will avoid the error, and
compiler will consider all unknown types to be "opaque", i.e. treat it
will them as existing in some external space.

Alternatively, instead of specifying command line argument
`--opaque-types=true` to the compiler, as of Kaitai Struct version 0.7,
it is now possible to specify `meta` field `ks-opaque-types` as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
meta:
  id: doc_container
  ks-opaque-types: true
seq:
  - id: doc
    type: custom_encrypted_object
----

NOTE: Of course, compiler don't know anything about opaque types, so
trying to access any attributes of it (i.e. using expression language)
will fail.

This will generate the following code (for example, in Java):

[source,java]
----
public class DocContainer extends KaitaiStruct {
    // ...
    private void _read() {
        this.doc = new CustomEncryptedObject(this._io);
    }
}
----

As you see, `CustomEncryptedObject` is instantiated here with a single
argument: IO stream. All that's left is to create a class with a
compatible constructor that will allow a call with single
argument. For statically typed languages, note that constructor's
argument is of type KaitaiStream.

An example of what can be done (in Java):

[source,java]
----
public class CustomEncryptedObject {
    byte[] buf;

    public CustomEncryptedObject(KaitaiStream io) {
        // read all remaining bytes into our buffer
        buf = io.readBytesFull();

        // implement our custom super Caesar's cipher
        for (int i = 0; i < buf.length; i++) {
            byte b = buf[i];
            if (b >= 'A' && b <= 'Z') {
                int letter = b - 'A';
                letter = (letter + 7) % 26;
                buf[i] = (byte) (letter + 'A');
            }
        }
    }
}
----

TIP: Alternatively, opaque types can be (ab)used to connect several
KS-generated types together without importing. If one type
instantiates other, but does not use it in any other way (i.e. doesn't
access its inner attributes using expression language), one can just
compile two .ksy files separately, throw them into the same project
and they shall use each other without a problem.

=== Enforcing parent type

Every object (except for the top-level object) in a .ksy file has a
parent, and that parent has a type, which is some sort of user-defined
type. What happens if two or more objects use the same type?

image::img/two_parents.svg[float="right"]

[source,yaml]
----
types:
  opcode_jmp:
    seq:
      - id: target
        type: arg
  opcode_push:
    seq:
      - id: value
        type: arg
  arg:
    seq:
      - id: arg_type
        type: u1
      - id: arg_value
        type: u1
----

In this example, both opcodes use same type `arg`. Given that these
are different types, KS infers that the only thing they have in common
is that they are objects generated by Kaitai Struct, and thus they
usually implement KaitaiStruct API, so the best common type that will
be ok for both parents is `KaitaiStruct`. Here's how it looks in any
statically-typed language, i.e, in Java:

[source,java]
----
public static class OpcodeJmp extends KaitaiStruct {
    // ...
    private void _read() {
        this.target = new Arg(this._io, this, _root);
    }
    // ...
}
public static class OpcodePush extends KaitaiStruct {
    // ...
    private void _read() {
        this.value = new Arg(this._io, this, _root);
    }
    // ...
}
public static class Arg extends KaitaiStruct {
    public Arg(KaitaiStream _io, KaitaiStruct _parent, TopLevelClass _root) {
----

Note that both `OpcodeJmp` and `OpcodePush` supply `this` as `_parent`
argument in `Arg` constructor, and, as it is declared as
`KaitaiStruct`. As both opcode classes are declared with `extends
KaitaiStruct`, this code will compile properly.

==== Replacing parent

However, in some situations, you might want to replace default `this`
passed as `_parent` with something else. In some situations this will
provide you a clean and elegant solution to relatively complex
problems. Consider the following data structure that loosely
represents a binary tree:

[source,yaml]
----
types:
  tree:
    seq:
      - id: chunk_size
        type: u4
      - id: root_node
        type: node
  node:
    seq:
      - id: chunk
        size: ??? # <= need to reference chunk_size from tree type here
      - id: has_left_child
        type: u1
      - id: has_right_child
        type: u1
      - id: left_child
        type: node
        if: has_left_child != 0
      - id: right_child
        type: node
        if: has_right_child != 0
----

Everything is pretty simple here. Main `tree` type has `chunk_size`
and a `root_node`, which is of `node` type. Each individual `node` of
this tree carries a chunk of information (of size determined in `tree`
type), some flags (`has_left_child` and `has_right_child`) and then
calls itself again to parse either left or right child nodes for
current node if they exist, according to the flags.

The only problem is how to access `chunk_size` in each node. You can't
access tree object starting from `_root` here, as there could be many
different trees in our file, so you need to access current one. Using
`_parent` directly is just impossible. True, given that `node` type is
used both by `tree` and `node` itself, it got two different parents,
so Kaitai Struct compiler downgrades node's parent type to
KaitaiStruct, thus trying to access `_parent.chunk_size` would result
in a compile-time error.

TODO: add more about the error

This situation can be resolved easily by using parent overriding. We
modify our code this way:

[source,yaml]
----
types:
  tree:
    seq:
      - id: chunk_size
        type: u4
      - id: root_node
        type: node
  node:
    seq:
      - id: chunk
        size: _parent.chunk_size # <= now one can access `tree` with _parent
      - id: has_left_child
        type: u1
      - id: has_right_child
        type: u1
      - id: left_child
        type: node
        parent: _parent # <= override parent to be be parent's parent
        if: has_left_child != 0
      - id: right_child
        type: node
        parent: _parent # <= override parent here too
        if: has_right_child != 0
----

We've changed only three lines. We've enforced parent of the node in
`left_child` and `right_child` attributes to be passed as `_parent`,
not `this`. This, effectively, continues passing reference to original
node's parent, which is a `tree` type object, over and over the whole
recursive structure. This way one can access structure's root by just
using `_parent`. Naturally, we've done exactly that to get ourselves
`chunk_size` by just using `size: _parent.chunk_size`.

==== Omitting parent

In some cases, you'd rather want some object to don't have any parent
at all. Primary use case for that is to make sure that some
instantiation it does not affect parent type. In many cases, resorting
to this method is a sign that you need to stop and rethink your
design, but for some formats, it's unavoidable and in fact simplifies
things a lot.

To omit parent (i.e. pass `null` reference or something similar as a
parent in one particular case), use `parent: false`.

[NOTE]
====
Language design explanation: while it might seem logical to specify
`parent: null`, there are two catches:

* KSY is a YAML-based language, and YAML treats `parent: null` as
  literally null value, i.e. totally the same as `parent:`. So, just
  to allow passing solitary `null` to as a value, you'd need to wrap
  it into quotes: `parent: 'null'`. This would be very awkward for
  beginners, as we can't even generate a good error message here, as
  we can't distinguish these two.
* Omitting parent is actually a special case, not just a matter of
  passing `null`. In fact, some languages do not have a concept of
  null, or do not allow passing null as an object reference, so we
  need to treat it distinctly anyway, and emphasize that.

TODO: an example where omitting the parent comes useful

== Common pitfalls

This section illustrates problems that are encountered frequently by
beginner Kaitai Struct users.

=== Specifying size creates a substream

In the following example script, an erronous attempt is made to parse
an input file with a file size of 2000 bytes:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: body
    type: some_body_type
    size: 1000
types:
  some_body_type:
    seq:
      - id: payload
        size: 999
      - id: overflow
        size: 2
----

The parser can successfully copy the required 999 bytes into
`body.payload` as the `body` substream has 1000 bytes available to
be requested, and the root stream has 2000 bytes available.

Where an exception occurs is upon attempting to copy data from the
`body` substream into the `overflow` object. After data has been
copied from the `body` substream into the `payload` object, the
`body` substream will only have 1 byte of data still available for
the parser to request. As 2 bytes of data are attempted to be
requested, the `body` substream is exhausted of available data and
thus an exception occurs. The fact that the root stream still has
1001 bytes available to be requested from the input file does not
matter, as the `body` substream never has the opportunity to request
any more than the first 1000 bytes of the input file.

=== Applying `process` without a size

In any cases, size of the data to process must be defined (either with
`size: ...` or with `size-eos: true`), i.e. this is legal (without
process - size takes will be determined by `some_body_type`, reading
normally from a stream):

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: body
    type: some_body_type
----

And this is not:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: body
    process: xor(0xaa)
    type: some_body_type
    # will not compile - lacks size
----

This is because most processing algorithms require to know size of data
to process beforehand, and final size of `some_body_type` might be
determined only in run-time, after parsing took place.
