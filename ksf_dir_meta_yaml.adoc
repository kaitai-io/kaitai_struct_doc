= YAML-based metadata for Kaitai Struct Formats directories

[[rationale]]
== Rationale
It is needed to store some metadata for each directory in `kaitai_struc_formats` repo.

[[general]]
== General

* YAML is used as a serialization format.

* `JSONSchema` will also be available.

[[metadata]]
== Metadata dict
There are 2 keys defined in a metadata dict:

* `short` for summary.

* `long` for more extended guidelines what goes into this dir and wat doesn't

All are mandatory.

[[tree]]
== Directory tree metadata format

* The file path relative to the repo root is `_build/dirMeta.yml`

* Each dir name is a key in a YAML dictionary.

* Metadata dict is stored in mandatory `_` subkey.

[[tags]]
== Format

* The file path relative to the repo root is `_build/tags.yml`

* Just a dict with keys that are tag names and values that are metadata dicts.
