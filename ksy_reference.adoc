= Kaitai Struct: KSY reference
:toc: left
:toclevels: 3
:source-highlighter: coderay

Kaitai Struct is a DSL (domain-specific language), designed to
describe binary data structures in human- and machine-readable
way. This reference is meant to be used as a complete spec on `.ksy`
files (that are used as input files for KS compiler): it will describe
how they work, which parts they consist of and how they're used /
processed. It contains a lot of technical info, so it's mostly suited
for those who want to write their own tools. If you just want to use
KS as end-user, please refer to <<user_guide.adoc#,user guide>>
instead.

The basic idea behind Kaitai Struct is very simple:

* One can describe a certain data structure using KS language (this is
  only needed to be done once)
* This description can be translated into a source code for many
  supported programming languages using a
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler[compiler],
  without the need to write language- and platform-specific code every
  time.
* Generated code can be plugged right into a project in target
  language (usually as a native module or a library) and used right
  away.

KS compiler gets one or several `.ksy` files for input.

[[ksy-file]]
## KSY files

Kaitai Struct data structure (format) descriptions (KSY files) are
simple http://yaml.org/[YAML] files and are usually saved using `.ksy`
extension to differentiate them from the rest of `.yaml` files.

Every `.ksy` file MUST be a valid YAML file, and is expected to be
parsed with generic YAML parsing libraries. Inside, every file MUST
provide a map of strings (keys) to some values. Each file is
essentially a single <<spec-type>>.

[[spec-type]]
## User-defined type spec

*User-defined type specification* is an essential component of KSY
specification. It declares a single user-defined type, which may
include:

* <<meta>>
* <<doc>>
* <<seq>>
* <<instances>>
* <<enums>>
* <<types>>
* <<params>>

NOTE: User-defined type spec is recursive and can include other
user-defined type specs inside `types` element.

Any `.ksy` file is a single user-defined type (exactly the same as any
nested subtypes), with two minor differences:

* top-level type spec MUST include <<meta-id,meta/id>> key that is
used to give a name for top-level type,
* all nested types MUST NOT have that key (as they already have a
certain ID from the map key name provided in <<types>>).

[[meta]]
### `meta` — meta-information

`meta` key is a map of string to objects that provides
meta-information relevant the current user-defined type or KSY file in
whole. It also can be used to assign some defaults and provide some
configuration options for compiler.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
meta:
  id: foo_arc
  title: Foo Archive
  application: Foo Archiver v1.23  
  file-extension:
    - fooarc
    - fooarcz
  license: CC0-1.0
  ks-version: 9.9
  imports:
    - common/archive_header
    - common/compressed_file
  encoding: UTF-8
  endian: le
----

[[meta-id]]
#### id

* Contents: a string that follows rules for all identifiers
* Purpose: identifier for a primary structure described in top-level map
* Influences: it would be converted to suit general formatting rules of a language and used as the name of class
* Mandatory: yes

[[meta-title]]
#### title

* Contents: a string
* Purpose: free-form text string that is a longer title of this .ksy file
* Influences: nothing
* Mandatory: no

[[meta-application]]
#### application

* Contents: a string
* Purpose: free-form text string that describes application that's associated with this particular format, if it's a format used by single application
* Influences: nothing
* Mandatory: no

[[meta-imports]]
#### imports

* Contents: sequence of strings which contain valid filesystem characters (generally A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _, - and /) corresponding to a relative or absolute path to another .ksy file (without the .ksy extension)
* Purpose: identify one or more .ksy files which will be imported
* Influences: allows types defined within the imported .ksy files to be used in the current context
* Mandatory: no

[[meta-encoding]]
#### encoding

* Contents: a string which is a user-defined encoding scheme, for example `ASCII`, `UTF-8`, `UTF-16LE`, `UTF-16BE`, `UTF-32LE`, `UTF-32BE` or a Name from the https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml[IANA character sets registry]
* Purpose: sets a default string encoding for this file
* Influences: if set, `str` and `strz` data types will have their encoding by default set to this value
* Mandatory: no

[[meta-endian]]
#### endian

* Contents: `le` (for little-endian) or `be` (for big-endian)
* Purpose: sets a default
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness[endianness] for this type
  and all nested subtypes
* Influences: if set, <<primitive-data-types,primitive data types>>
  like `u4` would be treated as aliases to `u4le` / `u4be` (depending
  on the setting); if not set, attempt to use abbreviated types like
  `u4` (i.e. without full endianness qualifier) will yield
  compile-time error.
* Mandatory: no

#### ks-version

* Contents: a string which contains a Kaitai Struct version number
* Purpose: sets the minimum version of Kaitai Struct Compiler (KSC) required to interpret this .ksy file
* Influences: prevents this .ksy file from being read by older versions of KSC which may not understand newer syntax of this .ksy file
* Mandatory: no

#### ks-debug

* Contents: `true` or `false` (default)
* Purpose: advise the Kaitai Struct Compiler (KSC) to use debug mode
* Influences: when set to `true`, KSC will generate classes as if --debug mode was specified in the command line
* Mandatory: no

#### ks-opaque-types

* Contents: `true` or `false` (default)
* Purpose: advise the Kaitai Struct Compiler (KSC) to ignore missing types in the .ksy file, and assume that these types are already provided externally by the environment the classes are generated for
* Influences: when set to `true`, KSC will generate classes as if --opaque-types=true mode was specified in the command line
* Mandatory: no

* Contents: a string or an array of strings
* Purpose: roughly identify which files can be parsed with this format by filename extension
* Influences: may be used for navigation purposes by browsing applications
* Mandatory: no

[[doc]]
### `doc` — docstrings

`doc` element is used to give a more detailed description of a
user-defined type. In most target languages, it will be used as
docstring (i.e. a special comment which is exported as part of code
documentation), compatible with tools like
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc[Javadoc],
http://www.doxygen.org/[Doxygen], http://usejsdoc.org/[JSDoc],
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b2s063f7.aspx[.NET XML
documentation comments], etc.

* Contents: free-form string (note that multiple lines are allowed and
  newlines would be respected during compilation)
* Purpose: provide longer description of a type for a developer that
  will use it
* Influences: generated docstring comments
* Mandatory: no

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
doc: |
  A variable-length unsigned integer using base128 encoding. 1-byte groups
  consists of 1-bit flag of continuation and 7-bit value, and are ordered
  "most significant group first", i.e. in "big-endian" manner.

  This particular encoding is specified and used in:

  * Standard MIDI file format
  * ASN.1 BER encoding
----

[[doc-ref]]
### `doc-ref` — documentation reference

`doc-ref` element can be used to provide reference to original
documentation, if your KSY file is actually an implementation of some
documented format.

* Contents: one of:
** URL as text
** Arbitrary string
** URL as text + space + arbitrary string
* Purpose: provide reference to original documentation (either in HTML
  form, available to be referenced by certain URL, or just a free-form
  reference that can be used to address printed manuals, etc)
* Influences: generated docstring comments, usually in a form of "see
  also".
** If only text is provided, it will be rendered as neutral text.
** If an URL is provided, it will be rendered an active hyperlink, if
   possible.
** If both URL and text is provided, it will create an active
   hyperlink that leads to URL, with a visible caption equal to
   provided text.
* Mandatory: no

Examples:

[source,yaml]
----
doc-ref: 'http://example.org/file-format-spec/1.0#header'
doc-ref: ECMA-119 standard, section 4.18 "Volume Set"
doc-ref: http://example.org/some-spec Header section
----

[[seq]]
### `seq` — sequence of attributes

* Contents: a sequence of <<spec-attribute>> elements
* Purpose: identifier for a primary structure described in top-level map
* Influences: would be translated into parsing method in a target class
* Mandatory: no

[[types]]
### `types` — declaration of subtypes

* Contents: map of strings to <<spec-type>>
* Purpose: declare types for sub-structures that could be referenced in <<spec-attribute>> in any `seq` or `instances` element
* Influences: would be translated into distinct classes (usually nested into main one, if target language allows it)
* Mandatory: no

[[instances]]
### `instances`

* Contents: map of strings to <<spec-instance>>
* Purpose: description of data that lies outside of normal sequential parsing flow (for example, that requires seeking somewhere in the file) or just needs to be loaded only by special request
* Influences: would be translated into distinct methods (that read desired data on demand) in current class
* Mandatory: no

[[enums]]
### `enums`

* Contents: map of strings to <<spec-enum>>
* Purpose: allow to set up named enums: essentially a mapping between
  integer constants to some symbolic names; these enums can be used in
  integer attributes using <<attribute-enum>> key, thus converting it
  from simple integer attribute into a proper enum constant
* Influences: would be represented as enum-like construct (or closest
  equivalent, if target language doesn't support enums), nested or
  namespaced in current type/class
* Mandatory: no

[[spec-attribute]]
## Attribute spec

**Attribute specification** describes how to read and write one
particular attribute — typically, a single number, a string, array of
bytes, etc. Attribute can also be a complex structure, specified with
a <<spec-type>>. Each attribute is typically compiled into equivalent
reading / writing instruction(s) in target language.

Every attribute MUST BE a map that maps certain keys to values. Some
of these keys are common to every possible attribute spec, some are
only valid for certain types.

Examples:

[source,yaml]
----
id: coord_x
type: f8
doc: X coordinate of a node.
----

[source,yaml]
----
id: body_len_64
type: u8
if: body_len_32 == 0
doc: |
  Additional value that designates length of the body as 64-bit
  integer. To save space in common cases where 32-bit store is enough,
  present only if `body_len_32` is set to 0.
----

[source,yaml]
----
id: body
type: encoded_body
size: (body_len_32 == 0) ? body_len_64 : body_len_32
process: zlib
----

### Common keys

[[attribute-id]]
#### id

* Contents: a string that matches `/^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$/` — i.e. starts with lowercase letter and then may contain lowercase letters, numbers and underscore
* Purpose: identify attribute among others
* Influences: used as variable / field name in target programming language
* Mandatory:
** yes (for attributes in a <<seq>>)
** forbidden (for attributes in <<instances>>)

[[attribute-doc]]
#### doc

[[attribute-doc-ref]]
#### doc-ref

[[attribute-contents]]
#### contents

* Contents: one of:
  * a string in UTF-8 encoding
  * an array of:
    * bytes in decimal representation
    * bytes in hexadecimal representation, starting with `0x`
    * strings in UTF-8 encoding
* Purpose: specify fixed contents that should be encountered by parser at this point
* Influences: parser checks if specified content exists at a given point in stream; if everything matches, then parsing continues; if content in the stream doesn't match bytes specified in given `contents`, it will trigger a parsing exception, thus signalling that something went terribly wrong and it's meaningless to continue parsing.
* Mandatory: no

Examples:

* `foo` — expect bytes `66 6f 6f`
* `[foo, 0, A, 0xa, 42]` — expect bytes `66 6f 6f 00 41 0a 2a`
* `[1, 0x55, '▒,3', 3]` — expect bytes `01 55 e2 96 92 2c 33 03`

NOTE: You can use either JSON or YAML array syntax, and quotes are
optional in YAML syntax.

[[attribute-type]]
#### type

* Contents: one of <<primitive-data-types,primitive data types>> or a
  name of <<spec-type>>
* Purpose: define a data type for an attribute
* Influences: how much bytes would be read, data type and contents of
  a variable in target programming language
* Mandatory: no — if `type` is not specified, then attribute is
  considered [a generic byte sequence](#no-type-specified)

If `type` is used to reference a <<spec-type>>, then the following
algorithm it used to find which type is referred to, given the name:

. It tries to find a given type by name in current type's
  <<types>> map.
. If that fails, it checks if current type actually has that name and
  if it does, uses current type recursively. Both type names given
  using a key in <<types>> and type name of top-level type given with
  <<meta-id,meta/id>> work.
. If that fails too, it goes one level up in the hierarchy of nested
  types and tries to resolve it there.

This mechanism is similar to the type name resolution algorithm that
is used by C++, Java, Ruby, etc, and allows one to effectively use
types as namespaces for subtypes, i.e. for example, this is legal:

[source,yaml]
----
meta
  id: top_level
seq:
  - id: foo
    type: header
    # resolves to /top_level/header ──┐
  - id: bar     #                     │
    type: body1 #                     │
  - id: baz     #                     │
    type: body2 #                     │
types:          #                     │
  header: # ... <─────────────────────┘ <─┐
  body1:             #                    │
    seq:             #                    │
      - id: foo      #                    │
        type: header #                    │
        # resolves to /top_level/header ──┘
  body2:
    seq:
      - id: foo
        type: header
        # resolves to /top_level/second_level/header ──┐
    types: #                                           │
      header: # ... <──────────────────────────────────┘
----

[[attribute-repeat]]
#### repeat

* Contents: `expr` or `eos` or `until`
* Purpose: designate repeated attribute in a structure;
** if `repeat: expr` is used, then attribute is repeated the number of
   times specified in `repeat-expr` key;
** if `repeat: eos` is used, then attribute is repeated until the end
   of current stream
** if `repeat: until` is used, then attribute is repeated until given
   expression becomes true (one may use a reference to last parsed
   element in such expression)
* Influences: attribute would be read as array / list / sequence,
  executing parsing code multiple times
* Mandatory: no

[[attribute-repeat-expr]]
#### repeat-expr

* Contents: <<expressions,expression>>, expected to be of integer type
* Purpose: specify number of repetitions for repeated attribute
* Influences: number of times attribute is parsed
* Mandatory: yes, if `repeat: expr`

[[attribute-repeat-until]]
#### repeat-until

* Contents: <<expressions,expression>>, expected to be of boolean type
* Purpose: specify expression that would be checked each time after an element of requested type is parsed; while expression is false (i.e. until it becomes true), more elements would be parsed and added to resulting array; one can use `_` in expression as a special variable that references last read element
* Influences: number of times attribute is parsed
* Mandatory: yes, if `repeat: until`

[[attribute-if]]
#### if

* Contents: <<expressions,expression>>, expected to be of boolean type
* Purpose: mark the attribute as optional
* Influences: attribute would be parsed only if condition specified in `if` key evaluates (in runtime) to true 
* Mandatory: no

### Byte array keys

If there's no type specified, attribute will be read just as a sequence of bytes from a stream. Thus, one has to decide on how many bytes to read. There are two ways:

* Specify amount of bytes to read in `size` key. One can specify an integer constant or an [[expression|expressions]] in this field (for example, if the number of bytes to read depends on some other attribute).
* Set `size-eos: true`, thus ordering to read all the bytes till the end of current stream.

#### size

#### size-eos

#### process

It is possible to apply some algorithmic processing to a byte buffer
before accessing it. This can be done using <<spec-process>>
syntax.

### Integer keys

One can map an integer to some <<spec-enum>> value with an `enum` attribute.

[[attribute-enum]]
#### enum

* Contents: name of existing `enum`
* Purpose: apply mapping of parsed integer using a given enum dictionary into some sort of named constant
* Influences: field data type becomes given enum
* Mandatory: no

### String keys

Specifies a fixed-length string, i.e. first it reads a designated number of bytes, then it tries to convert bytes to characters using a specified encoding. There are 2 ways to specify amount of data to read:

* Specify number of bytes to read directly in `size` key. One can specify an integer constant or an [[expression|expressions]] in this field (for example, if the number of bytes to read depends on some other attribute).
* Set `size-eos: true`, thus ordering to read all the bytes till the end of current stream.

#### size

#### size-eos

#### encoding

### `strz` keys

Specifies parsing a string until a `terminator` byte (i.e. C-style strings terminated with `0`).

#### terminator

* Contents: integer that represents terminating byte
* Purpose: string reading will stop when this byte will be encountered
* Influences: field data type becomes given enum
* Mandatory: no, default is `0`

#### consume

* Contents: boolean
* Purpose: specify if terminator byte should be "consumed" when reading - that is:
  * if `consume` is true, stream pointer will point to the byte after the terminator byte
  * if `consume` is false, stream pointer will point to the terminator byte itself
* Influences: stream position after reading of string
* Mandatory: no, default is `true`

#### include

* Contents: boolean
* Purpose: specify if terminator byte should be considered a part of string read and thus appended to it
* Influences: string parsed: if `true`, then resulting string would be 1 byte longer and that byte would be terminator byte
* Mandatory: no, default is `false`

#### eos-error

* Contents: boolean
* Purpose: allow ignoring of lack of terminator (disabling error reporting)
* Influences:
  * normally (if `eos-error` is `true`), reading a stream without encountering the terminator byte would result in end-of-stream exception being raised;
  * if `eos-error` is `false`, string reading will stop successfully at: either:
    * terminator being encountered, or
    * end of stream is reached
string parsed: if `true`, then resulting string would be 1 byte longer and that byte would be terminator byte
* Mandatory: no, default is `true`

[[primitive-data-types]]
## Primitive data types

There are several data types predefined in Kaitai Struct. They are
used as basic building blocks for more complex data types.

NOTE: Usually reading and writing of primitive data types is very fast
and efficient, as it is implemented in most "native" way possible in a
target language/platform. For example, if you need to read 2-byte
integer, it is usually much more efficient to just use `u2` type,
instead of doing two `u1` reads and then composing these two bytes
using <<instance-value,value instance>>".

### Integers

Generally, integer type specification follows this pattern: `([us])(1|2|4|8)(le|be)`

* First letter — `u` or `s` — specifies either unsigned or signed integer respectively
* Second group — `1`, `2`, `4` or `8` — specifies width of an integer in bytes
* Third group — `le` or `be` — specifies little-endian or big-endian
  encoding respectively; it can be omitted if default endianness
  specified in <<meta-endian,meta/endian>> in a type spec.

For the sake of completeness, here's the full table of available integer types:

[cols="6*", options="header"]

### Bit-size integers

To specify integers having non-standard number of bits in them, one
can use the following pattern: `b(\d+)`, where `(\d+)` is the number of
bits allocated. For example `b3` specifies a 3-bit integer.

### Floats

Floating point number specification also follows the general pattern: `f(4|8)(le|be)`

* First letter — `f` — specifies floating point type
* Second group — `4` or `8` — specifies width of an integer in bytes
* Third group — `le` or `be` — specifies little-endian or big-endian
  encoding respectively; it can be omitted if default endianness
  specified in <<meta-endian,meta/endian>> in a type spec.

The general format of float follows
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point[IEEE 754] standard.

The full list of possible floating point type is thus:

### Byte arrays

Byte arrays are used as generic "fallback" solution, where no
<<attribute-type>> is defined, but we have some means to understand
the size of the data. This means that one of the following is defined:

* <<attribute-size>> — fixed size byte array
* <<attribute-size-eos>>
* <<attribute-terminator>>

### Strings

Strings are built on top of byte arrays, inheriting all the properties
that allow to designate size of underlying byte array. To designate
attribute as string type, use `type: str` and provide encoding info,
either by specifying <<attribute-encoding>> key in the attribute, or
by applying type or file-wide default encoding in
<<meta-encoding,meta/encoding>>.

[NOTE]
====
`type: strz` can be also used as a shortcut to define a
null-terminated string (C-style). I.e. these `foo` and `bar`
attributes are equivalent:

[source,yaml]
----
- id: foo
  type: str
  terminator: 0
- id: bar
  type: strz
----
====

[[spec-process]]
## Processing spec

Sometimes the data you're working on is not only packed in some
structure, but also somehow encoded, obfuscated, encrypted,
compressed, etc. So, to be able to parse such data, one has to remove
this layer of encryption / obfuscation / compression / etc. This is
called "processing" in Kaitai Struct and it is supported with a range
of `process` directives. These can be applied to raw byte buffers or
user-typed fields in the following way:

```yaml
seq:
  - id: buf1
    size: 0x1000
    process: zlib
```

This declares a field named `buf1`. When parsing this structure, KS
will read exactly 0x1000 bytes from a source stream and then apply
`zlib` processing, i.e. decompression of zlib-compressed
stream. Afterwards, accessing `buf1` would return decompressed stream
(which would be most likely larger than 0x1000 bytes long), and
accessing `_raw_buf1` property would return raw (originally
compressed) stream, exactly 0x1000 bytes long.

There are following processing directives available in Kaitai Struct.

[[process-xor]]
### xor(key)

Applies a bitwise XOR (bitwise exclusive "or", written as `^` in most C-like languages) to every byte of the stream. Length of output stays exactly the same as the length of input. There is one mandatory argument - the key to use for XOR operation. It can be:

* a single byte value — in this case this value would be XORed with every byte of the input stream
* an array of bytes — in this case, first byte of the input would be XORed with first byte of the key, second byte of the input with second byte of the keys, etc. If the key is shorter than the input, key will be reused, starting from the first byte.

For example, given 3-byte key `[b0, b1, b2]` and input line `[x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, ...]` output will be:

```
[x0 ^ b0, x1 ^ b1, x2 ^ b2,
 x3 ^ b0, x4 ^ b1, ...]
```

Examples:

* `process: xor(0xaa)` — XORs every byte with `0xaa`
* `process: xor([7, 42])` — XORs every odd (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) byte with `7`, and every even (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) byte with `42`
* `process: xor(key_buf)` — XORs bytes using a key stored in a field named `key_buf`

[[process-rol]]
### rol(key), ror(key)

Does a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift[circular shift]
operation on a buffer, rotating every byte by `key` bits left (`rol`)
or right (`ror`).

Examples:

* `process: rol(5)` — rotates every byte 5 bits left: every given bit
  combination `b0-b1-b2-b3-b4-b5-b6-b7` becomes
  `b5-b6-b7-b0-b1-b2-b3-b4`
* `process: ror(some_val)` — rotates every byte right by number of
  bits determined by `some_val` attribute (which might be either
  parsed previously or calculated on the fly)

[[process-zlib]]
### zlib

Applies a `zlib` decompression to input buffer, expecting it to be a full-fledged zlib stream, i.e. having a regular 2-byte zlib header. Decompression parameters are chosen automatically from it. Typical zlib header values:

* `78 01` — no compression or low compression
* `78 9C` — default compression
* `78 DA` — best compression

Length of output buffer is usually larger that length of the input. This processing method might throw an exception if the data given is not a valid zlib stream.

[[spec-instance]]
## Instance spec

*Instance specification* is very close to <<spec-attribute>> (and
inherits all its properties), but it specifies an attribute that lies
beyond <<seq,regular parsing sequence>>. Typically, each instance is
compiled into a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation[lazy]
reader function/method that will parse (or calculate) requested data
on demand, cache the result and return whatever's been parsed
previously on subsequent calls.

Everything that described in <<spec-attribute>> can be used, except
for <<attribute-id>>, which is useless, because all instances already
have name due to map string key.

[[instance-pos]]
### pos

Specifies position in a stream from which the value should be parsed.

[[instance-io]]
### io

Specifies an IO stream from which a value should be parsed.

[[instance-value]]
### value

Overrides any reading & parsing. Instead, just calculates function
specified in `value` and returns the result as this instance. Can be
used for multitude of purposes, such as data conversion while reading,
etc.

[[spec-enum]]
## Enum spec

*Enum specification* allows to set up a enum (or closest equivalent)
construct in target language source file, which can then be referenced
in attribute specs using <<attribute-enum>> key.

A given type can have multiple named enums, each of which is
essentially a map from integers to strings. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
enums:
  ip_protocol:
    1: icmp
    6: tcp
    0x11: udp
  port:
    22: ssh
    25: smtp
    80: http
----

This one defines 2 named enums (named `ip_protocol` and `port`
respectively), which can be referenced in attributes like that:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: src_port
    type: u2
    enum: port
----

Enum-mapped fields can be also used in <<expressions>>. One can
compare it to enum constants, referencing it using
*enum_name*`::`*enum_string* syntax:

```yaml
seq:
  - id: http_version
    type: u1
    if: src_port == port::http
```

or one can convert them back into an integer, for example:

```yaml
seq:
  - id: field_for_privileged_port
    type: u1
    if: src_port.to_i < 1024
```

[[expressions]]
## Expressions

Some fields (for example, <<attribute-repeat-expr>>,
<<attribute-size>>, or <<attribute-if>>) allow to specify either
constant values (for example, `123`) or an expression that could
reference another attributes or instances.

A very typical example would be:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: filename_len
    type: u4
  - id: filename
    type: str
    size: filename_len
    encoding: UTF-8
----

Here we do two things:

* First, we read 4-byte unsigned integer is read and store it in
  `filename_len` attribute
* Second, we read an UTF-8 encoded string exactly `filename_len` bytes
  long, where `filename_len` is a reference the previous attribute

These expressions form a fairly powerful expression language that
would be translated into a relevant expression in target programming
language.
