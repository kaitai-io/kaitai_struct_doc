= KST: Kaitai Struct Tests

Traditionally, testing Kaitai Struct relied on running specs which
do the following:

* for every target language
* given:
** an input binary file,
** a library generated by Kaitai Struct Compiler for that target
   language
* we run library's parsing procedure on an input file, getting
  ourselves some structure in memory with the parsed contents of input
  file
* finally, we compare the actual results of parsing with expected
  result: we take certain key members of structure in memory and
  assert that they should be equal to what we expect, or within
  certain boundaries.

While the procedure itself is solid, it quickly becomes very
labor-intensive to support that, as number of languages that KS
supports grows. Adding a new test now requires addition of ~10-12
per-language spec files, and doing that manually is both inefficient
and error-prone.

The solution for that comes from Kaitai Struct compiler itself: we
already have an expression language that might be used to address
structures in memory, so why not use that to generate test specs as
well?

== KST format

Cross-language test specs are described in KST (=Kaitai Struct Test)
format, which is also a YAML-based format, similar to KSY.

[source,yaml]
----
id: foo_bar
data: expr_array.bin
asserts:
  - actual: aint_size
    expected: 4
----

Here:

* `id` is a name of a test spec, which MUST match exactly the name of
  a KSY file in
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_tests/tree/master/formats[formats]
  dir.
* `data` is the name of input binary datafile, which MUST be present
  in
  https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_tests/tree/master/src[src]
  dir; by convention, we use ".bin" file extension for all these files.
* `asserts` is a sequence of assertions that we'll use to check that
  contents of parsed structure in memory match our expectations.
+
Every assertion has two parts:
+
** `actual` is a KS expression, executed in context of root element
   of KSY file that we're tested, used to extract a certain member of
   structure in memory to check.
** `expected` is normally some constant that we expect it to match
   (but it is also a KS expression, so technically it can be
   non-constant).

Assertions are expected to be fatal (i.e. first failed assertion stops
the test process) and are specifically executed in sequence in
specified in `asserts`.

This file must be saved as `foo_bar.kst` (i.e. name MUST match the
`id` and the name of relevant .ksy file) in
https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_tests/tree/master/spec/ks[spec/ks]
dir.

When test is expected to fail with an exception, a slightly different
KST file is used:

[source,yaml]
----
id: valid_fail_contents
data: fixed_struct.bin
exception: ValidationNotEqualError<bytes>
----

No `asserts` are present in this case, but there is a top-level
`exception` element, which lists the expected exception to be raised
during the parsing stage of this test. Available exception names are
listed in
https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler/blob/master/shared/src/main/scala/io/kaitai/struct/datatype/KSError.scala[KSError.scala]
in kaitai-struct-compiler.

== Invoking KST translator

To make use of KST specs, they need to be translated into actual
target languages (just like KSY gets compiler into target languages),
so there is a translator project to do that.

KST translator is heavily based of kaitai-struct-compiler, so one
needs to compile and publish .jar files with kaitai-struct-compiler to
local repository first:

[source,shell]
----
# assuming we're in root project directory
cd compiler
sbt publishLocal
----

after that, one can invoke it using
https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_tests/blob/master/build-tests[build-tests]
script in tests:

----
KST translator 0.10
Usage: kst_translator [options] [<test_name>...]

  <test_name>...           source test names (.kst)
  -t, --target <language>  target languages (construct, cpp_stl_98, cpp_stl_11, csharp, go, java, javascript, nim, perl, php, python, ruby, rust, default: all)
  --all-specs              process all KST files available
  -f, --force              force overwrite specs in production spec dirs (default: generate in ../spec/ks/out)
----

For example, to generate specs in all possible target languages right
in the all relevant dirs for one KST spec "foo_bar", one can run:

[source,shell]
----
cd ../tests
./build-tests -f foo_bar
----
